    "In this lesson, we learned about the `map` function.  The `map` function is a great way to reduce the amount of information that we are working with, to make things easier.  The map function takes two arguments.  In the second argument we pass through our the list that we will be operating on, `map(,employees)`.  Then, in the first argument we indicate what we will to do each element in that list: assign each element to a variable, and then operate on that variable. `map(employee: employee['name'], )`.  Finally, we wrap our function `map` in a list so that we are returned a list of our new elements: \n",
