    "In this lesson, we learned about functions.  Functions are a way for us to wrap up a procedure -- like our `len` function that performs the procedure of calculating the length of a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "We saw how to write our own functions, that can have names of our choice, and also a do what we would like.  We did this in three steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First we wrote the function signature with the line `def capitalize_names():`.  The `def` keyword tells Python we are about to build a function, then we have the name of the function, followed by parentheses, and end the first line with a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we write the procedure, or the act that a function performs after that function signature.  We can write code like we always wrote, like `mapping` through a list of names, but if we place that code in a function, we can call that procedure repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we saw that even though our function will perform the procedure, we do not see that end result without a `return` statement at the end of the function.  Any variables defined in the function are stuck inside of that function unless we have `return` statement at the end to specify what is thrown over the walls of the function.   "
