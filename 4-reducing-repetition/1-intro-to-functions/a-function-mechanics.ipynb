    "As we build up our knowledge of code, we can see some of our code becoming repetitive.  As a coder, we try to avoid repetition so that there is less code to maintain.  We've already seen one way of reducing repetition: variables.  Variables allow us to declare *data* once and run it multiple times.  As we'll see, functions allow us to write a *procedure* once, and reference and execute that procedure multiple times.  Ok, let's start learning about functions."
